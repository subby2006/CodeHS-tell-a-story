lol wut

This is my tell-a-story project for Practice PT 6.1.5.
This is in the public domain, so feel free to copy, modify, do whatever you want with it.
If you are copying the entire main.js file and putting it to your project becaus your lazy ass is to lazy to do it, please consider changing some stuff (variables, design, story) cuz teachers might already know about this repo
